# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** v13.0 Language Completeness — Phase 127 Plan 01 complete, Plan 02 next

## Current Position

Phase: 127 of 131 (Type Aliases) — In Progress
Plan: 01 complete — Plan 02 next
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — 127-01 complete: pub type parsing fix, ALIAS-04 undefined type validation, E2E test

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 27% (3/11 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**All-time Totals (through v12.0):**
- Plans completed: 343
- Phases completed: 125
- Milestones shipped: 22 (v1.0-v12.0)

**v13.0 plan (11 plans across 6 phases):**

| Phase | Plans | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 126. Multi-line Pipe | 2 | Complete (2/2) |
| 127. Type Aliases | 2 | In Progress (1/2) |
| 128. TryFrom/TryInto | 2 | Not started |
| 129. Map.collect + Quality | 2 | Not started |
| 130. Mesher Dogfooding | 1 | Not started |
| 131. Documentation | 2 | Not started |

**v13.0 Execution Metrics:**

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 126 | P01 | 4m 7s | 2 | 8 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 127 (Type Aliases) listed as independent of 126 — can run in parallel if desired
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 128 (TryFrom) depends on Phase 127 — type aliases may appear in TryFrom signatures
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 129 groups Map.collect fix (MAPCOL-01) with code quality (QUAL-01, QUAL-02) — small independent fixes bundled together
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 130 (Dogfooding) deferred until all compiler phases complete — prevents rework
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 131 (Docs) after dogfooding — examples sourced from verified Mesher patterns
- [Phase 126]: Made is_newline_insignificant pub(crate) rather than adding a new method — minimal change
- [Phase 126]: Named regression test e2e_pipe_126_regression (not e2e_pipe_regression_single_line) because e2e_pipe already exists
- [Phase 127-01]: ALIAS-04 validation skips generic aliases (type Pair<A,B>=...) since type vars aren't in registry
- [Phase 127-01]: target_type_name() returns None for complex types — only validates simple single-IDENT alias targets to avoid false positives

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v12.0 fully shipped. v13.0 roadmap created with 100% requirement coverage (17/17 mapped).
