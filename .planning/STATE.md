# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** Phase 116 — Slot Pipe Operator (first phase of v12.0)

## Current Position

Phase: 121 of 123 (Phase 121: Mesh Agent Skill)
Plan: 01 complete (1 of 4 plans)
Status: Phase 121 in progress — root SKILL.md + syntax + types sub-skills written; 3 remaining sub-skill plans
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — 121-01 complete: Mesh agent skill scaffold created (skill/mesh/SKILL.md + syntax + types sub-skills)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5% (v12.0)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 115]: Documentation-only gap closure: Phase 106/109 implementations were correct, only tracking records were missing
- [Phase 115]: Phase 109 positional API (insert_or_update, delete_where_returning, where_sub) accepted as canonical v11.0 API
- [Phase 115]: get_project_id_by_key and get_user_orgs removed from queries.mpl (zero import sites)
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: Phase 119 (Regex) depends only on Phase 115 -- may run in parallel with 117-118 if desired
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: Phase 121 (Agent Skill) depends only on Phase 115 -- no code changes, can run at any point
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: PIPE-05 and STRG-06 bundled into Phase 120 (Mesher Dogfooding) after all compiler work done
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: REPO (Phase 122) scheduled after Mesher dogfooding -- disruptive restructure deferred until language features stable
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: BENCH (Phase 123) scheduled last -- depends on repo being stable for benchmark code commit location
- [Phase 116-01]: |0> and |1> emit TokenKind::Error at lex time (hard error by design, not recoverable parse error)
- [Phase 116-01]: SlotPipe uses same Pratt binding power (3, 4) as Pipe -- chain with equal precedence
- [Phase 116-01]: todo!() placeholders added to mesh-typeck and mesh-codegen to unblock builds until Plan 02
- [Phase 116-02]: Slot pipe uses insertion semantics — x |2> f(a,b,c) = f(a,x,b,c); conflict check removed, arity unification handles mismatches
- [Phase 116-02]: SlotPositionConflict error variant exists in enum but not emitted in normal insertion; SlotPipeOutOfRange emitted when slot > known arity
- [Phase 117]: Both ${ and #{ emit identical InterpolationStart tokens — parser/codegen require zero changes, only lexer updated
- [Phase 117]: apply_heredoc_content() processes each STRING_CONTENT segment independently to handle interpolation boundaries; mid-line content after #{} is left untouched
- [Phase 117]: into_token() used instead of as_token() in iterator chains to avoid Rust E0515 borrow errors
- [Phase 118]: Old bare env_get (Option-returning) removed entirely from builtins.rs; env_get now routes to 2-arg mesh_env_get_with_default
- [Phase 118]: env_get_int silently returns default on any parse failure (non-numeric, overflow) — no stderr warning required
- [Phase 118]: env_args type signature upgraded to Ty::list(Ty::string()) in builtins.rs
- [Phase 118]: stdlib_modules() Env entry in infer.rs updated to 2-arg get, get_int, args signatures (was stale 1-arg Option-returning)
- [Phase 118]: get_env_or_default helper removed from mesher/main.mpl; all callsites use direct Env.get(key, default)
- [Phase 119]: RegexExpr.pattern()/flags() parse CST source text (not TokenKind payload) since SyntaxToken only stores text spans
- [Phase 119]: Flags bitmask i=1, m=2, s=4; only i/m/s valid -- other letters produce lexer Error token
- [Phase 119]: mesh_regex_from_literal call site wired in Plan 01; runtime symbol added in Plan 02
- [Phase 119]: Bool return for mesh_regex_match uses i8 (matches mesh_string_contains convention)
- [Phase 119]: No bare regex 'replace'/'split' in map_builtin_name (would conflict with string variants); module-qualified regex_replace/regex_split unambiguous
- [Phase 119]: Regex.is_match used instead of Regex.match: 'match' is a Mesh keyword causing parse errors
- [Phase 119]: Ty::Con(Regex) maps to MirType::Ptr in types.rs resolve_con: opaque heap pointer, prevents LLVM opaque struct failures
- [Phase 119]: Regex added to STDLIB_MODULE_NAMES in infer.rs: required for Regex.compile/is_match/etc to route through module call path
- [Phase 120]: Slot pipe applied only in fingerprint.mpl where genuine argument threading exists; other API files already use idiomatic patterns
- [Phase 120]: Heredocs used for JSON builders with 2+ embedded double quotes; simple error strings use regular #{} without heredoc
- [Phase 120]: HTTP test assertions fixed: unescape_string() in MIR lowerer correctly processes backslash escapes; test comments claiming otherwise were stale since Phase 117
- [Phase 121]: Skill lives at skill/mesh/ inside snow repo with SKILL.md format (frontmatter + numbered rules + code examples from tests/e2e/)

### Roadmap Evolution

- v12.0 roadmap created 2026-02-25: 8 phases (116-123), 33 requirements mapped, 100% coverage
- Phase ordering: compiler features first (116-119), then dogfooding (120), then skill (121), then repo (122), then benchmarks (123)
- Phase 124 added: Fix POST /api/v1/events 401 seed data issue

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v11.0 fully shipped and verified. Zero known compiler correctness issues.
