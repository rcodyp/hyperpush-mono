# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** v13.0 Language Completeness — Phase 131 complete (Documentation: cheatsheet + type-system guide), v13.0 fully shipped

## Current Position

Phase: 132 of 132 (Improve Language JSON Handling) — In Progress
Plan: 01 complete — Wave 1 done; proceeding to Wave 2 (codegen)
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — 132-01 complete: json keyword, JsonExpr AST, parser, Ty::json() newtype, Json→String unify coercion

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 33% (1/3 plans)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 127 (Type Aliases) listed as independent of 126 — can run in parallel if desired
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 128 (TryFrom) depends on Phase 127 — type aliases may appear in TryFrom signatures
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 129 groups Map.collect fix (MAPCOL-01) with code quality (QUAL-01, QUAL-02) — small independent fixes bundled together
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 130 (Dogfooding) deferred until all compiler phases complete — prevents rework
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 131 (Docs) after dogfooding — examples sourced from verified Mesher patterns
- [Phase 126]: Made is_newline_insignificant pub(crate) rather than adding a new method — minimal change
- [Phase 126]: Named regression test e2e_pipe_126_regression (not e2e_pipe_regression_single_line) because e2e_pipe already exists
- [Phase 127-01]: ALIAS-04 validation skips generic aliases (type Pair<A,B>=...) since type vars aren't in registry
- [Phase 127-01]: target_type_name() returns None for complex types — only validates simple single-IDENT alias targets to avoid false positives
- [Phase 127]: Used single-file fallback form for E2E pub type alias test since compile_and_run writes one main.mpl file
- [Phase 127]: Made TypeRegistry::register_alias pub to allow pre-registration from infer_with_imports
- [Phase 127]: Added DOT to collect_annotation_tokens and IDENT.DOT.IDENT joining in parse_type_tokens to support qualified type annotations like Types.UserId
- [Phase 127]: Register imported aliases under qualified name (Types.UserId) as well as short name (UserId) during infer_with_imports pre-registration
- [Phase 127]: Use fn main() wrapper in cross-module fixtures — all compile_multifile_and_run tests require a main function
- [Phase 128-01]: No built-in TryFrom impls added — TryFrom is user-defined only (unlike From which ships Int->Float/String)
- [Phase 128-01]: TryInto return_type set to None in synthetic impl — actual Result<T,E> resolved per-impl from user body
- [Phase 128-02]: Struct boxing threshold changed from >8 to always-box — ptr slot in {i8,ptr} variant layout is always dereferenced, even 8-byte structs must be heap-allocated
- [Phase 128-02]: TryInto return type now mirrors TryFrom return type at synthesis time so type-checker accepts .try_into() calls
- [Phase 128-02]: impl method return type now uses resolve_type_annotation (handles generic types) over resolve_type_name (simple ident only)
- [Phase 129]: Fixed Map.collect string key dispatch for Iter.zip: extended pipe_chain_has_string_keys with Iter.zip detection (rhs_is_iter_zip + pipe_source_has_string_list) instead of result-type check, because HM let-generalization prevents K=String unification at collect-pipe time
- [Phase 129-02]: Passthrough middleware (next(request) body) requires :: Request annotation — without it, type variable gets generalized as forall T; codegen emits {} (empty struct) LLVM type → SIGBUS at runtime. Handler inference works when body uses Request.* accessors (constrains type before generalization).
- [Phase 130-01]: FromImportDecl handler in infer.rs didn't check mod_exports.type_aliases — importing a pub type alias by name caused E0034. Fixed by adding type_aliases check branch in the import name lookup chain.
- [Phase 130-01]: WS close callback unannotated code/reason parameters caused LLVM {} type mismatch (same root cause as Phase 129-02 passthrough middleware). Fixed with :: Int and :: String annotations.
- [Phase 131]: Type Aliases section placed after Generics and before Structs to match conceptual progression
- [Phase 131]: TryFrom/TryInto section placed immediately after From/Into as natural fallible extension
- [Phase 131]: Language Basics Multi-Line Pipes placed as H3 under Pipe Operator, Type Aliases as H2 before What's Next; cheatsheet entries added inline in existing blocks

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 132 added: Improve language JSON handling with native object literal syntax instead of manual string concatenation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v12.0 fully shipped. v13.0 roadmap created with 100% requirement coverage (17/17 mapped).
