# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 105.1: Pass MIR return type to codegen_service_call_helper for type-aware reply conversion
- Phase 105.1: Construction-side fix only for struct-in-Result: existing codegen_leaf deref logic handles destructuring
- Phase 105.1: Auth workaround reverted -- authenticate_request returns Project!String directly
- Phase 105.1: EventProcessor service call SIGSEGV persists -- needs dedicated investigation
- [Phase 106]: OR clause encoding uses OR:field1,field2,...:N format with field names embedded in clause string
- [Phase 106]: ILIKE added as atom_to_sql_op mapping -- no new function needed, works via existing where_op
- [Phase 106]: Unified renumber_placeholders helper handles both ? and $N styles in a single pass
- [Phase 106]: RAW: prefix reused for ORDER BY and GROUP BY raw expressions, consistent with existing pattern
- [Phase 107]: ALIAS: prefix encoding distinguishes aliased from regular joins in join_clauses list
- [Phase 107]: SQL aliases (AS) used in JOIN queries for unambiguous column names in runtime E2E tests
- [Phase 108]: RAW: prefix reused for aggregate SELECT expressions -- consistent with existing select_raw pattern
- [Phase 108]: select_count (no args) and select_count_field (with field) split for cleaner API
- [Phase 108]: Raw SQL strings in runtime E2E tests match query builder output -- Plan 01 verifies pipeline, Plan 02 verifies SQL semantics
- [Phase 109]: Subquery WHERE uses inline SQL serialization at where_sub call time, stored as RAW: clause with ? placeholders
- [Phase 109]: E2E tests verify compilation pipeline without runtime execution since Repo functions expect PoolHandle not SqliteConn
- [Phase 109]: Runtime E2E uses raw SQL via Sqlite.query matching build_upsert_sql_pure output (Repo functions require PoolHandle, not SqliteConn)
- [Phase 109]: Pre-existing type checker arity bug: let x = Sqlite.execute(db, sql, params)? followed by f(x) triggers spurious E0003
- [Phase 109.1]: E0003 root cause was missing Int.to_string in typeck stdlib, not a type inference bug
- [Phase 109.1]: Use BasicMetadataTypeEnum->BasicTypeEnum try_from conversion for struct type in build_load
- [Phase 109.1]: Service arg decoercion pattern: after loading i64, convert to expected handler param type via inverse of coerce_to_i64
- [Phase 110]: Repo.delete_where type signature corrected from Ptr to Result<Int, String> to match runtime behavior
- [Phase 110]: Two-step ORM pattern for PG crypto: minimal Repo.query_raw SELECT for expression, then Repo.insert for data
- [Phase 110]: Repo.update_where type signature corrected: fields_map from Ptr to Map<String,String>, return from Ptr to Result<Map,String>
- [Phase 111]: assign_issue retains Repo.execute_raw for NULL unassign branch -- ORM Map<String,String> cannot represent NULL
- [Phase 111]: 4 complex queries retain raw SQL with documented ORM boundary rationale (upsert_issue, check_volume_spikes, insert_event, extract_event_fields)
- [Phase 112]: Inline let = case ... end not supported by Mesh parser; use helper functions for case expressions
- [Phase 112]: acknowledge_alert and resolve_fired_alert retain execute_raw for SET column = now() server-side function calls
- [Phase 112]: toggle_alert_rule and check_new_issue verified as already rewritten by Plan 01
- [Phase 112]: list_alerts uses Query.join_as with status passed 3 times for optional status filter
- [Phase 113]: delete_expired_events uses Repo.delete_where + Query.where_raw for interval expression -- interval arithmetic expressible via where_raw
- [Phase 113]: update_project_settings retains raw SQL: COALESCE with server-side JSONB extraction + fallback to current column not expressible via Repo.update_where Map<String,String>
- [Phase 113]: check_sample_rate retains raw SQL: random() comparison with scalar subquery + COALESCE default not expressible via ORM query builder
- [Phase 114]: MirType::Tuple SIGSEGV fix confirmed active: arm returns context.ptr_type(...) heap pointer, not by-value struct -- no crash during Mesher startup
- [Phase 114]: PostgreSQL running in Docker mesher-postgres (postgres:16-alpine); single migration 20260216120000_create_initial_schema applied cleanly
- [Phase 114]: Mesher startup reaches [Mesher] Foundation ready with all 7 services started; EventProcessor SIGSEGV does not manifest at startup (triggered by POST /api/v1/events, tested in 114-02)
- [Phase 114]: Event ingestion uses x-sentry-auth header (not X-Api-Key) -- confirmed from mesher/ingestion/auth.mpl
- [Phase 114]: POST /api/v1/events returns 202 Accepted; all 8 HTTP domain endpoints return 2xx; WebSocket :8081 returns 101; process alive -- MirType::Tuple SIGSEGV confirmed resolved
- [Phase 115]: Documentation-only gap closure: Phase 106/109 implementations were correct, only tracking records were missing
- [Phase 115]: Phase 109 positional API (insert_or_update, delete_where_returning, where_sub) accepted as canonical v11.0 API; keyword-option style was never implemented
- [Phase 115]: get_project_id_by_key and get_user_orgs removed from queries.mpl (zero import sites; superseded and unwired respectively)

### Roadmap Evolution

- v11.0 roadmap created: 9 phases (106-114), 32 requirements mapped
- Phase 109.1 inserted after Phase 109: Fix the issues encountered in 109 (URGENT)
- Phase 115 added: Tracking corrections and API acceptance (shipped 2026-02-25)
- v11.0 Query Builder complete: all 10 phases (106-115) shipped 2026-02-25

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. The EventProcessor SIGSEGV blocker is confirmed resolved (MirType::Tuple fix -- types.rs returns ptr not by-value struct). POST /api/v1/events returned 202 with Mesher process alive after all endpoint tests.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-25
Stopped at: v12.0 milestone started. Requirements defined (33 requirements across 6 categories). Roadmap pending.
Resume file: None
Next action: Complete roadmap creation, then /gsd:plan-phase 116
