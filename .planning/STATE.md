# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-17)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** v11.0 Query Builder -- Phase 111

## Current Position

Phase: 111 of 114 (v11.0 Query Builder) -- IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-18 -- Completed 111-01 (Rewrite issue management queries to ORM)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 56% (v11.0)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 105.1: Pass MIR return type to codegen_service_call_helper for type-aware reply conversion
- Phase 105.1: Construction-side fix only for struct-in-Result: existing codegen_leaf deref logic handles destructuring
- Phase 105.1: Auth workaround reverted -- authenticate_request returns Project!String directly
- Phase 105.1: EventProcessor service call SIGSEGV persists -- needs dedicated investigation
- [Phase 106]: OR clause encoding uses OR:field1,field2,...:N format with field names embedded in clause string
- [Phase 106]: ILIKE added as atom_to_sql_op mapping -- no new function needed, works via existing where_op
- [Phase 106]: Unified renumber_placeholders helper handles both ? and $N styles in a single pass
- [Phase 106]: RAW: prefix reused for ORDER BY and GROUP BY raw expressions, consistent with existing pattern
- [Phase 107]: ALIAS: prefix encoding distinguishes aliased from regular joins in join_clauses list
- [Phase 107]: SQL aliases (AS) used in JOIN queries for unambiguous column names in runtime E2E tests
- [Phase 108]: RAW: prefix reused for aggregate SELECT expressions -- consistent with existing select_raw pattern
- [Phase 108]: select_count (no args) and select_count_field (with field) split for cleaner API
- [Phase 108]: Raw SQL strings in runtime E2E tests match query builder output -- Plan 01 verifies pipeline, Plan 02 verifies SQL semantics
- [Phase 109]: Subquery WHERE uses inline SQL serialization at where_sub call time, stored as RAW: clause with ? placeholders
- [Phase 109]: E2E tests verify compilation pipeline without runtime execution since Repo functions expect PoolHandle not SqliteConn
- [Phase 109]: Runtime E2E uses raw SQL via Sqlite.query matching build_upsert_sql_pure output (Repo functions require PoolHandle, not SqliteConn)
- [Phase 109]: Pre-existing type checker arity bug: let x = Sqlite.execute(db, sql, params)? followed by f(x) triggers spurious E0003
- [Phase 109.1]: E0003 root cause was missing Int.to_string in typeck stdlib, not a type inference bug
- [Phase 109.1]: Use BasicMetadataTypeEnum->BasicTypeEnum try_from conversion for struct type in build_load
- [Phase 109.1]: Service arg decoercion pattern: after loading i64, convert to expected handler param type via inverse of coerce_to_i64
- [Phase 110]: Repo.delete_where type signature corrected from Ptr to Result<Int, String> to match runtime behavior
- [Phase 110]: Two-step ORM pattern for PG crypto: minimal Repo.query_raw SELECT for expression, then Repo.insert for data
- [Phase 110]: Repo.update_where type signature corrected: fields_map from Ptr to Map<String,String>, return from Ptr to Result<Map,String>
- [Phase 111]: assign_issue retains Repo.execute_raw for NULL unassign branch -- ORM Map<String,String> cannot represent NULL

### Roadmap Evolution

- v11.0 roadmap created: 9 phases (106-114), 32 requirements mapped
- Phase 109.1 inserted after Phase 109: Fix the issues encountered in 109 (URGENT)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Event ingestion (POST /api/v1/events) crashes during background EventProcessor service call after HTTP response is sent. Requires deeper investigation of EventProcessor service loop state or call dispatch.
