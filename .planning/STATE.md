# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone — use `/gsd:new-milestone` to define v13.0

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 115]: Documentation-only gap closure: Phase 106/109 implementations were correct, only tracking records were missing
- [Phase 115]: Phase 109 positional API (insert_or_update, delete_where_returning, where_sub) accepted as canonical v11.0 API
- [Phase 115]: get_project_id_by_key and get_user_orgs removed from queries.mpl (zero import sites)
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: Phase 119 (Regex) depends only on Phase 115 -- may run in parallel with 117-118 if desired
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: Phase 121 (Agent Skill) depends only on Phase 115 -- no code changes, can run at any point
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: PIPE-05 and STRG-06 bundled into Phase 120 (Mesher Dogfooding) after all compiler work done
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: REPO (Phase 122) scheduled after Mesher dogfooding -- disruptive restructure deferred until language features stable
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: BENCH (Phase 123) scheduled last -- depends on repo being stable for benchmark code commit location
- [Phase 116-01]: |0> and |1> emit TokenKind::Error at lex time (hard error by design, not recoverable parse error)
- [Phase 116-01]: SlotPipe uses same Pratt binding power (3, 4) as Pipe -- chain with equal precedence
- [Phase 116-01]: todo!() placeholders added to mesh-typeck and mesh-codegen to unblock builds until Plan 02
- [Phase 116-02]: Slot pipe uses insertion semantics — x |2> f(a,b,c) = f(a,x,b,c); conflict check removed, arity unification handles mismatches
- [Phase 116-02]: SlotPositionConflict error variant exists in enum but not emitted in normal insertion; SlotPipeOutOfRange emitted when slot > known arity
- [Phase 117]: Both ${ and #{ emit identical InterpolationStart tokens — parser/codegen require zero changes, only lexer updated
- [Phase 117]: apply_heredoc_content() processes each STRING_CONTENT segment independently to handle interpolation boundaries; mid-line content after #{} is left untouched
- [Phase 117]: into_token() used instead of as_token() in iterator chains to avoid Rust E0515 borrow errors
- [Phase 118]: Old bare env_get (Option-returning) removed entirely from builtins.rs; env_get now routes to 2-arg mesh_env_get_with_default
- [Phase 118]: env_get_int silently returns default on any parse failure (non-numeric, overflow) — no stderr warning required
- [Phase 118]: env_args type signature upgraded to Ty::list(Ty::string()) in builtins.rs
- [Phase 118]: stdlib_modules() Env entry in infer.rs updated to 2-arg get, get_int, args signatures (was stale 1-arg Option-returning)
- [Phase 118]: get_env_or_default helper removed from mesher/main.mpl; all callsites use direct Env.get(key, default)
- [Phase 119]: RegexExpr.pattern()/flags() parse CST source text (not TokenKind payload) since SyntaxToken only stores text spans
- [Phase 119]: Flags bitmask i=1, m=2, s=4; only i/m/s valid -- other letters produce lexer Error token
- [Phase 119]: mesh_regex_from_literal call site wired in Plan 01; runtime symbol added in Plan 02
- [Phase 119]: Bool return for mesh_regex_match uses i8 (matches mesh_string_contains convention)
- [Phase 119]: No bare regex 'replace'/'split' in map_builtin_name (would conflict with string variants); module-qualified regex_replace/regex_split unambiguous
- [Phase 119]: Regex.is_match used instead of Regex.match: 'match' is a Mesh keyword causing parse errors
- [Phase 119]: Ty::Con(Regex) maps to MirType::Ptr in types.rs resolve_con: opaque heap pointer, prevents LLVM opaque struct failures
- [Phase 119]: Regex added to STDLIB_MODULE_NAMES in infer.rs: required for Regex.compile/is_match/etc to route through module call path
- [Phase 120]: Slot pipe applied only in fingerprint.mpl where genuine argument threading exists; other API files already use idiomatic patterns
- [Phase 120]: Heredocs used for JSON builders with 2+ embedded double quotes; simple error strings use regular #{} without heredoc
- [Phase 120]: HTTP test assertions fixed: unescape_string() in MIR lowerer correctly processes backslash escapes; test comments claiming otherwise were stale since Phase 117
- [Phase 121]: Skill lives at skill/mesh/ inside snow repo with SKILL.md format (frontmatter + numbered rules + code examples from tests/e2e/)
- [Phase 121-02]: Sub-skills use cross-references via 'See also: skills/<name>' pattern for related concept linking
- [Phase 121]: Actors sub-skill includes self() self-messaging pattern for actor loops (from tce_actor_loop.mpl)
- [Phase 121]: Supervisors sub-skill cross-references actors sub-skill — supervisors manage actors
- [Phase 121]: Collections sub-skill: module-qualified (List.map) preferred over global bare forms; Iter pipeline lazy evaluation documented as key performance distinction
- [Phase 121]: strings sub-skill covers #{} and ${} interpolation (both syntaxes), heredocs, 11 String functions, Env.get/get_int, and full Regex API with literals and runtime compile
- [Phase 121]: http sub-skill documents router rebind convention (let r = HTTP.use(r, ...)) and covers routing/middleware/client/WebSocket/crash isolation
- [Phase 121]: database sub-skill covers Sqlite/PostgreSQL raw APIs, deriving(Row) ORM, upserts/RETURNING/subqueries, JOINs, and gotchas (execute vs query for RETURNING)
- [Phase 122]: Root package.json deleted (not moved to website/) because website/ already has its own real package.json; root was dev-only concurrently wrapper
- [Phase 122]: crates/ flattened directly to compiler/ with no intermediate directory — all 11 crates are direct children of compiler/
- [Phase 122]: Docker/Mesher E2E test skipped in 122-02 — container crashed; user approved and confirmed E2E works
- [Phase 123]: Port assignments: Mesh=3000, Go=3001, Rust=3002, Elixir=3003 — consistent across all benchmark plans
- [Phase 123]: Port 3000 for Mesh benchmark server, port 3001 for Go benchmark server (hardcoded, wrk runner script uses these)
- [Phase 123]: Go benchmark uses GOMAXPROCS(NumCPU()) at startup for fair multi-core CPU utilization comparison
- [Phase 123]: Mesh compiler built from compiler/ Rust workspace in Dockerfile (mesher/ contains only macOS arm64 binary)
- [Phase 123]: Internal DNS hostname (bench-servers.vm.bench-mesh.internal) recommended over raw IPv6 to avoid bracket notation issues
- [Phase 123]: RSS logged as CSV to stdout (RSS,lang,epoch,kB) every 2s; extracted via fly logs | grep '^RSS,'
- [Phase 124]: projects.slug ON CONFLICT requires WHERE slug IS NOT NULL predicate to match partial index (bare ON CONFLICT (slug) causes PostgreSQL runtime error)
- [Phase 124]: Seed migration uses Pool.execute for INSERT/DELETE and Repo.query_raw for SELECT, matching existing schema migration pattern
- [Phase 125]: README.md updated to v12.0 with isolated benchmarks (29,108/28,955 req/s) and correct HTTP module syntax
- [Phase 125]: Pipe Operators feature renamed (plural) to encompass both standard |> and slot pipe |N> in one feature card
- [Phase 125]: Slot pipe |2> example uses insert_at('[', ']') pattern derived from tests/e2e/slot_pipe_basic.mpl
- [Phase 125]: Cheatsheet String Features section added to consolidate heredoc, regex, and env examples in one scannable block; Operators table split to fix factual error (++ is list concat, <> is string concat)
- [Phase 125]: getting-started: #{} shown first in interpolation bullet with ${} noted as 'also valid'; language-basics: Heredoc Strings and Slot Pipe Operator added as standalone subsections

### Roadmap Evolution

- v12.0 roadmap created 2026-02-25: 8 phases (116-123), 33 requirements mapped, 100% coverage
- Phase ordering: compiler features first (116-119), then dogfooding (120), then skill (121), then repo (122), then benchmarks (123)
- Phase 124 added: Fix POST /api/v1/events 401 seed data issue
- Phase 125 added: update documentation such that it is up to date in the main read me, landing page, documents page. Use the mesh test's that are all passing as the source of truth.
