# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** Phase 116 — Slot Pipe Operator (first phase of v12.0)

## Current Position

Phase: 118 of 123 (Phase 118: Env Var Stdlib)
Plan: 02 complete (phase complete)
Status: Phase 118 complete — Phase 119 next
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — 118-02 complete: E2E tests for Env.get/Env.get_int, all callers migrated to 2-arg API

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5% (v12.0)

## Performance Metrics

**All-time Totals:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 115]: Documentation-only gap closure: Phase 106/109 implementations were correct, only tracking records were missing
- [Phase 115]: Phase 109 positional API (insert_or_update, delete_where_returning, where_sub) accepted as canonical v11.0 API
- [Phase 115]: get_project_id_by_key and get_user_orgs removed from queries.mpl (zero import sites)
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: Phase 119 (Regex) depends only on Phase 115 -- may run in parallel with 117-118 if desired
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: Phase 121 (Agent Skill) depends only on Phase 115 -- no code changes, can run at any point
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: PIPE-05 and STRG-06 bundled into Phase 120 (Mesher Dogfooding) after all compiler work done
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: REPO (Phase 122) scheduled after Mesher dogfooding -- disruptive restructure deferred until language features stable
- [v12.0 Roadmap]: BENCH (Phase 123) scheduled last -- depends on repo being stable for benchmark code commit location
- [Phase 116-01]: |0> and |1> emit TokenKind::Error at lex time (hard error by design, not recoverable parse error)
- [Phase 116-01]: SlotPipe uses same Pratt binding power (3, 4) as Pipe -- chain with equal precedence
- [Phase 116-01]: todo!() placeholders added to mesh-typeck and mesh-codegen to unblock builds until Plan 02
- [Phase 116-02]: Slot pipe uses insertion semantics — x |2> f(a,b,c) = f(a,x,b,c); conflict check removed, arity unification handles mismatches
- [Phase 116-02]: SlotPositionConflict error variant exists in enum but not emitted in normal insertion; SlotPipeOutOfRange emitted when slot > known arity
- [Phase 117]: Both ${ and #{ emit identical InterpolationStart tokens — parser/codegen require zero changes, only lexer updated
- [Phase 117]: apply_heredoc_content() processes each STRING_CONTENT segment independently to handle interpolation boundaries; mid-line content after #{} is left untouched
- [Phase 117]: into_token() used instead of as_token() in iterator chains to avoid Rust E0515 borrow errors
- [Phase 118]: Old bare env_get (Option-returning) removed entirely from builtins.rs; env_get now routes to 2-arg mesh_env_get_with_default
- [Phase 118]: env_get_int silently returns default on any parse failure (non-numeric, overflow) — no stderr warning required
- [Phase 118]: env_args type signature upgraded to Ty::list(Ty::string()) in builtins.rs
- [Phase 118]: stdlib_modules() Env entry in infer.rs updated to 2-arg get, get_int, args signatures (was stale 1-arg Option-returning)
- [Phase 118]: get_env_or_default helper removed from mesher/main.mpl; all callsites use direct Env.get(key, default)

### Roadmap Evolution

- v12.0 roadmap created 2026-02-25: 8 phases (116-123), 33 requirements mapped, 100% coverage
- Phase ordering: compiler features first (116-119), then dogfooding (120), then skill (121), then repo (122), then benchmarks (123)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v11.0 fully shipped and verified. Zero known compiler correctness issues.
