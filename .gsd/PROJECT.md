# Project

## What This Is

Mesh is a programming language and backend application platform repository aimed at being trustworthy for real backend and distributed-systems work, not just toy examples. The repo contains the compiler, runtime, formatter, LSP, REPL, package tooling, docs site, package registry, packages website, landing site, and dogfood applications used to pressure-test the language.

M048 is complete. The repo now ships a default-plus-override executable-entry contract across compiler build/test, `mesh-lsp`, editor hosts, and `meshpkg publish`; installer-backed `meshc update` / `meshpkg update`; truthful editor grammar and init-time Mesh skill guidance for `@cluster` plus both interpolation forms; and one retained closeout rail (`bash scripts/verify-m048-s05.sh`) plus bounded public docs that keep first-contact tooling claims honest.

M049 is now complete. The repo no longer teaches `todo-api` onboarding through repo-root proof apps: `meshc init --template todo-api --db postgres <name>` emits the migration-first shared/deployable starter, `meshc init --template todo-api --db sqlite <name>` emits the explicit local single-node starter, generator-owned `examples/todo-postgres` and `examples/todo-sqlite` mirror scaffold output mechanically, repo-root `tiny-cluster/` and `cluster-proof/` have been retired in favor of fixture-backed retained proofs under `scripts/fixtures/clustered/`, and one assembled closeout rail (`bash scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh`) now replays the dual-db scaffold, example parity, public-surface retirement, and retained M039/M045/M047/M048 guardrails into a single retained bundle.

The current wave continues the evaluator-facing public-surface reset: M050 will rewrite public docs into evaluator-facing material instead of a proof maze, M051 will retire `reference-backend/` in favor of `mesher/` as the deeper living reference app, and later milestones will align landing/packages/deploy/load-balancing surfaces with that same truthful story.

M049/S01-S05 are complete. `meshc init --template todo-api --db postgres <name>` emits the migration-first shared/deployable starter from S01, `meshc init --template todo-api --db sqlite <name>` emits the explicit local single-node starter from S02, and S03 checks in generator-owned `/examples/todo-postgres` and `/examples/todo-sqlite` as public `meshc init` output instead of hand-maintained showcase trees. S04 retired the repo-root `tiny-cluster/` and `cluster-proof/` onboarding surfaces entirely, moved those proofs under `scripts/fixtures/clustered/`, repointed retained Rust and shell rails to shared fixture helpers, and made the public clustered story scaffold/examples-first while keeping the lower-level proof fixtures available only through retained verifier/docs surfaces. S05 closes that reset with one named assembled verifier: `bash scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh` replays the dual-db scaffold rails, direct `/examples` parity, retained M039/M045/M047 clustered proof wrappers, and the retained M048 tooling rail, then publishes one retained bundle under `.tmp/m049-s05/verify/retained-proof-bundle/`. The SQLite path still passes generator, tooling, and live runtime rails; `/health` reports local SQLite state without clustered metadata; restart persistence is proven against the retained `todo.sqlite3`; the old clustered SQLite Todo contract now lives behind the committed M047 fixture plus retained verification bundles instead of behind the public scaffold; and the assembled S05 bundle now retains fresh `m049-s01`, `m049-s02`, and `m049-s03` artifact buckets alongside the delegated historical verify trees.

M050/S01 is complete. The docs graph now makes `Getting Started` and `Clustered Example` the only primary first-contact entries, keeps `Distributed Proof` and `Production Backend Proof` public but secondary under `Proof Surfaces`, and fixes the VitePress footer resolver so `Clustered Example` no longer self-links through prefix matching. The new fast rail, `bash scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh`, proves the source-level graph, the retained M047 and production-proof docs contracts, and the built HTML footer behavior without Postgres or heavier scaffold/example replays; `bash scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh` now runs it first as the docs-graph preflight.

## Core Value

If Mesh claims it can cluster, route work, survive node loss, and report truthful runtime status, those claims must be proven through small docs-grade examples where the language/runtime owns the magic instead of the example app reimplementing distributed behavior — including the syntax users actually write.

The public Mesh story should stay honest: Mesh is a general-purpose language, but its strongest proof surface and clearest value are fault-tolerant distributed systems and backend workloads.

## Current State

Mesh already ships a broad backend-oriented stack:
- Rust workspace crates under `compiler/` for lexing, parsing, type checking, code generation, runtime, formatter, LSP, REPL, package tooling, and CLI commands
- native compilation to standalone binaries
- runtime support for actors, supervision, HTTP, WebSocket, JSON, database access, migrations, files, env, crypto, datetime, and collections
- a distributed runtime surface with node start/connect/list/monitor, remote spawn/send, continuity, authority, and clustered-app tooling
- dogfooded applications: `reference-backend/` as the narrow backend proof surface, `mesher/` as the broader pressure test, and retained clustered proof fixtures under `scripts/fixtures/clustered/tiny-cluster` plus `scripts/fixtures/clustered/cluster-proof`
- a real package registry service in `registry/`, a public packages website in `packages-website/`, a docs site in `website/`, and a separate landing site in `mesher/landing/`
- editor surfaces including the VS Code extension and repo-owned Neovim pack

Recent distributed-runtime state:
- M039 proved automatic cluster formation, truthful membership, runtime-native internal balancing, and single-cluster degrade/rejoin on a narrow proof app
- M042 moved single-cluster keyed continuity into `mesh-rt` behind a Mesh-facing `Continuity` API
- M043 proved cross-cluster primary/standby continuity, bounded promotion, and packaged same-image failover/operator rails
- M044 productized clustered apps: manifest opt-in, runtime-owned declared-handler execution, built-in read-only operator/CLI surfaces, `meshc init --clustered`, bounded automatic promotion/recovery, and a rewritten `cluster-proof` on the public clustered-app contract
- M045 simplified the clustered example story around runtime-owned bootstrap, runtime-chosen remote execution, automatic failover, and scaffold-first docs
- M046 closed the route-free clustered proof wave: `meshc init --clustered` plus the internal `scripts/fixtures/clustered/tiny-cluster` and `scripts/fixtures/clustered/cluster-proof` proofs now share one tiny `1 + 1` clustered-work contract, and the authoritative closeout rail is `bash scripts/verify-m046-s06.sh`
- M047 completed the public cutover to source-first `@cluster`, carried replication counts through runtime truth, shipped `HTTP.clustered(...)`, and updated the Todo scaffold, docs, and closeout rails around that shipped route wrapper

Public docs and repo teaching surfaces are still uneven in ways the next wave needs to fix, even though M048's first-contact surfaces are now truthful:
- the default-plus-override `[package].entrypoint` contract now spans compiler build, test discovery, LSP, editor hosts, and `meshpkg publish`; first-contact docs also point at the retained `bash scripts/verify-m048-s05.sh` closeout rail and keep `main.mpl` as the simple default while documenting override entries such as `lib/start.mpl`
- the reset wave now includes explicit installer-backed `meshc update` / `meshpkg update` commands, bounded VS Code same-file-definition wording, manifest-first editor proof, and retained parity rails for `@cluster`, both interpolation forms, and clustered-runtime teaching truth: `bash scripts/verify-m036-s01.sh`, `NEOVIM_BIN="${NEOVIM_BIN:-nvim}" bash scripts/verify-m036-s02.sh syntax`, `node --test scripts/tests/verify-m036-s02-contract.test.mjs`, `node --test scripts/tests/verify-m048-s04-skill-contract.test.mjs`, and the assembled `bash scripts/verify-m048-s05.sh`
- broader public docs now have the M050/S01 structural graph reset (`Getting Started` + `Clustered Example` first, proof pages public-secondary under `Proof Surfaces`, fast preflight via `bash scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh`), but the evaluator-facing copy rewrite and lower-level proof-page reconciliation still belong to later M050 slices
- the landing site still reflects stale product positioning rather than Mesh's actual language story
- `reference-backend/` still exists even though the next wave is expected to retire it in favor of `mesher/`

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- Rust workspace under `compiler/` with separate crates for parser, type checker, codegen, runtime, formatter, LSP, CLI, REPL, package tooling, and package manager code
- backend-first proof surfaces through narrow reference apps and shell verifiers, not marketing-only examples
- proof-first dogfooding: reproduce a real runtime/platform limitation, fix it at the correct layer, then prove the repaired path end to end
- explicit honesty boundaries when behavior is genuinely environment-specific; avoid claiming portability or automation that the runtime does not really own
- assembled closeout verifiers own a fresh `.tmp/<slice>/verify` bundle and retain delegated subrails by copying their verify trees plus bundle pointers, rather than sharing or mutating lower-level `.tmp/.../verify` directories directly
- current clustered runtime surface lives primarily in `compiler/mesh-rt/src/dist/`, `compiler/mesh-codegen/`, `compiler/mesh-typeck/`, and `compiler/meshc/`, with user-facing docs in `website/docs/docs/distributed/` and scaffold generation in `compiler/mesh-pkg/src/scaffold.rs`
- clustered HTTP routes now reuse the same declared-handler seam as ordinary clustered work: compiler lowering rewrites `HTTP.clustered(...)` to deterministic `__declared_route_<runtime_name>` bare shims, router registration reverse-maps those shims onto declared-handler runtime metadata, and continuity/operator views stay keyed by the real handler runtime name rather than the shim symbol
- for the next wave, public evaluator-facing surfaces should stay simpler than internal proof rails: scaffold/examples first, Mesher as the deeper real app, and repo verifier detail kept out of the primary docs story
